python-design-patterns
===============
Use python to implement classic design patterns in Object-Oriented Programming. This repository may also include some example code snippets borrowed from open source codes in classic python libraries I've read. I will update them continually.    
  
Now, I have updated several design patterns as follows:  
###Creational Patterns
* [**Abstract Factory**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/abstract%20factory) 
* [**Builder**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/builder) 
* [**Prototype**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/prototype) 
* [**Factory Method**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/factory%20method) 
* [**Singleton**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/singleton) 

###Structual Patterns  
* [**Adapter**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/adapter) 
* [**Bridge**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/bridge)
* [**Composite**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/composite) 
* [**Decorator**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/decorator)
* [**Facade**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/facade)
* [**Flyweight**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/flyweight) 
* [**Proxy**](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/proxy) [copy on write with Proxy](https://github.com/conndots/python-design-patterns/tree/master/proxy/proxy_copy_on_write.py)
  
###Behavioral Patterns
