design-patterns-in-action
===============
Use Python/Ruby/Java to implement classic design patterns in Object-Oriented Programming. This repository also include some example code snippets borrowed from open source codes in classic python libraries I've read. I will update them continually.    
  
Now, I have updated several design patterns as follows:  
###Creational Patterns
* [**Abstract Factory**](https://github.com/conndots/ddesign-patterns-in-action/tree/master/abstract%20factory) 
* [**Builder**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/builder) 
* [**Prototype**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/prototype) 
* [**Factory Method**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/factory%20method) 
* [**Singleton**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/singleton)  [从Java实现Singleton模式的一个bug到Java内存模型](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/singleton/README.md)

###Structual Patterns  
* [**Adapter**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/adapter) [Adapter to implement Duck Type in java](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/adapter/Adapter2Duck.java)
* [**Bridge**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/bridge)
* [**Composite**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/composite) 
* [**Decorator**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/decorator) [Using Java annotations to implement decorator pattern](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/decorator/RefactorTestUtil) [cache property](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/blob/master/decorator/cacheproperty.py)
* [**Facade**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/facade)
* [**Flyweight**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/flyweight) 
* [**Proxy:**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/proxy) [copy on write with Proxy](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/proxy/proxy_copy_on_write.py)
  
###Behavioral Patterns  
* [**Chain of Responsibility**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/chain%20of%20responsibility)  
* [**Command**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/command)
* [**Interpretor**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/interpretor)  
* [**Iterator**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/iterator)  
* [**Mediator**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/mediator)
* [**Memento**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/memento)  
* [**Observer**](https://github.com/conndots/design-patterns-in-action/tree/master/observer)
